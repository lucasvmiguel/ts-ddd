# Awesome Project Build with TypeORM

* Everything exported should be set in the package's index.js
* npm package should be imported only in implementation packages
* avoid to use npm packages everywhere, centralize them and use interfaces - because later on it will be easier to replace if needed it
* test mocks should be shareable with all the tests
